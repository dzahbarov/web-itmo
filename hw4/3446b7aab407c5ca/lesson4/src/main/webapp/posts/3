Hi Codeforces ଘ(੭*ˊᵕˋ)੭* ੈ♡‧₊˚!

We're delighted to invite you to COMPFEST 13 — Finals Online Mirror (Unrated, ICPC Rules, Teams Preferred) on суббота, 2 октября 2021 г. в 16:35.

All problems were written and prepared by hocky, steven.novaryo, rama_pang, JulianFernando, Zap, Panji, richiesenlia, Sakamoto, and markus_geger.

I would also like to thank:

KAN for helping to host the mirror round;
(AVM.Martin, Ace_02), Berted, ardan, wijayareynaldo, and bukanYohandi for testing the round locally and improved the problems in early phases;
UWr Kobor 53 (w0nsh, kobor, Fly_37), Almost Retired (KAN, Um_nik, Ekler), and errorgorn for testing the round and their really useful feedbacks;
Universitas Indonesia, all the local committees, administrators, and managers of the whole COMPFEST event;
prabowo for observing the contest;
fushar for the Judgels platform used in the official contest; and finally
MikeMirzayanov for the great Codeforces and our lovely Polygon!
Extra thanks for rama_pang and steven.novaryo for working hard night 🌚 and day 🌞 making sure the problems are well-prepared (the contest wouldn't exist without their hands).
The duration will be 5 hours, consisting of 13 problems. You can register individually, but teams are preferred. You may expect relatively easier problems than ICPC Regional Contests. You may code parallely with several computers with your teammates and use prewritten codes and templates.

COMPFEST itself is an annual event hosted by Universitas Indonesia. It is the largest student-run IT event in Indonesia and competitive programming contest is one of the competitions hosted.

We've put great effort into preparing this contest and we hope that you will enjoy it. See you! ありがとう~! 🐾
