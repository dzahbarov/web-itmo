(Good Morning), Codeforces!

I'm glad to invite you to Codeforces Round #746 (Div. 2), which will be held on воскресенье, 3 октября 2021 г. в 17:35.

This round is rated for the participants with rating lower than 2100.

You will be given 6 problems and 2 hours to solve them. All problems were prepared by me and Bakry_.

One of the problems will be interactive. So, it is recommended to read the guide on interactive problems before the round.
